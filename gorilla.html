				 <h3>GORILLA</h3>
				 <p>Gorillas are herbivours, predominantly gorund-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or  five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
				 
				 <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa, Although their range covvers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging on altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres(7,200 tp 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea levels, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.</p>
				 
				 <p>There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching , habitat detruction, and diesease, which threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live.</p>
