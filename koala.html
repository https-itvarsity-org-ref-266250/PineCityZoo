				<h3>KOALA</h3>
				<p>The Koala or inaccurately koala bear(Phascolarcots cinereus), is an arbol herbivours marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats.</p><p>The koala is found in coatsal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailess body and large head round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.</p>
				 
			    <p>The Koala has a body length of 60-85 cm(24-33 in)and weighs 4-15 kg(9-33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate broth. Koalas from the northen populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are seperate subspecies, but this is disputed.</p>
				<p>Koala typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet.</p>
				<p>This eucalyptus diet has low nutritinal and caloric content and contains toxins that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours day.</p>
			    <p>They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependant offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals ad attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretios from scent glands located on their chests.</p><p>Being marsupials,koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mother's pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives.</p><p>These young koalas, known as joeys are fully weaned around a year a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala rectrovirus.</p>
				 
				<p>Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculuture, urbanisation, droughts, and associated bushfires, some some related to climate change.</p>
				 
				<p><strong>WHERE WILL WE FIND THEM?</strong></p>
				<p>You will find the Koalas on south near the giraffe section.</p>
