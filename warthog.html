				<h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
		  <p>The common warthog(Phacocheourus africanus)is a wild member of the pig family(Suidae)found in grassland, savanna, woodland in sub-Sharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P.aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desrt warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethopia.</p>
		  <p>The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head and body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 m(2 ft 11 in to 4 ft 11 in) and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85 cm(25.0 to 33.5 in).Females, at 45 kg to 75 kg(99 to 165 lb), are smaller and lighter than males, at 60 to 150 kg(130 to 330 lb).A warthog is is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks potruding from the mouth and curving upwards. THe lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed.The upper canine teeth can grow to 25..5 cm(10.0 in) long and have a wide elliptical cross section, being 4.5 cm(1.8) deep and 2.5 cm(0.98 in)wide. The tusks are not used for digging, but are used for combat with other hogs and in defense against predators-the lower set can inflict severe wounds.</p>
		 
		  <p>Common warthog ivory is taken from the contsantly growing canine teeth. The tusks, particularly the upper set, work in much the same way as elephant tusks with all designs scaled down.Tusks are carved predominately for the tourist trade in eastern and dothern Africa.</p>
		  
		  <p>The head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back. Common warthogs do not have subcutaneous fat and the coat is spare, making them susceptible to extreme environmental temperatures.</p>
