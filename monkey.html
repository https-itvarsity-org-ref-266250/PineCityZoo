				<h3>MONKEYS</h3>
				<p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to the most mammalss of the infraorder Simiiformes, aalso knows as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes(Hominoid) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to  their scope.</p>
				 
			    <p>In 1812, Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidea group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, "Old world monkeys", ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in french) The extant sister of the Ctarrhini in the monkey group is the New World Monkeys.</p>
				 
				<p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling, although there are species that live primarily on the ground such as baboos. Most species are mainly active during the day.Monkeys generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old world monkeys.</p><p>Lemurs, lorises and galgos are not monkeys but strepsirrhine primates(suborder Strepirrhini) The simians' sister group, the tarsiers, are also ha;phorhine primates; however, they are a;so not monkeys.</p>
				 
				<p>Monkeys including apes can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectorial nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.</p>
