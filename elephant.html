				<h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
			    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recocgnised, the African elephant(Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although somme evidence suggests that African bush elaphants and African forest elephants are seperate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throught sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extict, members of the order include deinotheres , gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach the height of 4 m(13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
				<p>All elephants have several disnctive features, the most notable of which is a truck or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects.Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.Elephants' large ear flaps helps to control their body temperature.
