				<h3>PANDAS</h3>
				<p>The giant panda(Aluropoda melanoleuca, sometimes panda bear or simply panda)is a bear species endemic to china.It is charactised by its bold black and white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivore, the giant panda is a folivore, with baboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild occassionally eat other grassses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.</p>
			    <p>In capivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub, oranges, or banans along with specially prepared food.</p>
				<p>The giant oanda lives in amountaun ranges in central China, mainky in Sichuan, and also in neighboring Shaanxi, and Gansu.As a result of farming, deforestaition and ither development,, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it onece lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.</p>
